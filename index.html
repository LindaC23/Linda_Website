    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Linda Chen! I just turned 17 as of September 11th, 
        and I'm looking forward to the new school year! I'm a beginner to web development, so I hope
    to learn many new things in this class. Thank you! </p>

    <h3>Random Facts</h3>
    <p>My favorite animals are actually penguins! My fascination with marine life actually led me to volunteer
        at the <a href="https://nyaquarium.com">New York Aquarium</a> this summer. I loved being able to see the marine animals every weekend while 
        educating visitors daily about various conservation efforts. Over the summer, I also interned at a nonprofit organization and attended a
        Blockchain bootcamp. Both of these opportunities were great learning experiences as well! 
    </p>

    <p>This is a photo of my penguin keychain! I named it Pedro II because I previously had a different penguin keychain originally named Pedro, 
        but I lost it!!</p>
